# lzw
This is my implementation of the Lempel–Ziv–Welch compression algorithm.
While needing to implemenent LZW for gif files this became a useful library.
I am using this as an example project for use by the public with reference to the author.
This algorithm should be compatible with DICOMs Deflate transfer syntax.
